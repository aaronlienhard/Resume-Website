I'm a third year Human Centered Design and Development student at Penn State University. I'm interested in Web Development, particularly Front End Development as well as UI/UX Design. I have also been self-studying Japanese since June 2020 and have passed a mock N1 JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) exam.
