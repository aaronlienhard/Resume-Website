### Prosthetic Customizer

    - A class project where we created an app idea that would allow people with prosthetic limbs customize the limbs 
    and make them more unique to themselves
    
    - Conducted user studies, heuristic evaluations, created scenarios, use case diagrams, 
    a stylesheet, and worked with a group of 3 total people
